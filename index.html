				<h1>Ambani</h1>
					<p>Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani was born on 19 April 1957 in the British Crown colony of Aden (present-day Yemen) into a Gujarati Hindu family to Dhirubhai Ambani and Kokilaben Ambani. He has a younger brother Anil Ambani and two sisters, Nina Bhadrashyam Kothari and Dipti Dattaraj Salgaonkar.Ambani lived only briefly in Yemen because his father decided to move back to India in 1958[9] to start a trading business that focused on spices and textiles. The latter was originally named "Vimal" but later changed to "Only Vimal".[10][11] His family lived in a modest two-bedroom apartment in Bhuleshwar, Mumbai until the 1970s.[12] The family's financial status slightly improved when they moved to India but Ambani still lived in a communal society, used public transportation, and never received an allowance.[13] Dhirubhai later purchased a 14-floor apartment block called 'Sea Wind' in Colaba, where, until recently, Ambani and his brother lived with their families on different floors.</p>

						<p>In 1981 he started to help his father Dhirubhai Ambani run their family business, Reliance Industries Limited. By this time, it had already expanded so that it also dealt in refining and petrochemicals. The business also included products and services in the retail and telecommunications industries. Reliance Retail Ltd., another subsidiary, is also the largest retailer in India.[19] Reliance's Jio has earned a top-five spot[further explanation needed] in the country's telecommunication services since its public launch on 5 September 2016. 2016, Ambani was ranked as the 36th richest person in the world</p>

					<p>A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or biological sources, such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. Sediments settle in different densities and structures, depending on the local wave action and weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or layers of material.Though some beaches form on inland freshwater locations such as lakes and rivers, most beaches are in coastal areas where wave or current action deposits and reworks sediments. Erosion and changing of beach geologies happens through natural processes, like wave action and extreme weather events. Where wind conditions are correct, beaches can be backed by coastal dunes which offer protection and regeneration for the beach. However, these natural forces have become more extreme due to climate change, permanently altering beaches at very rapid rates. Some estimates describe as much as 50 percent of the earth's sandy beaches disappearing by 2100 due to climate-change driven sea level rise.[2]</p>

					<h1>Nature</h1>
						<p>Nature is beautiful, yet it is difficult to put into words. Nature is honoured with a variety of religious traditions. The primary source of life on Earth is the components that exist naturally. All of the elements are linked. Natural ingredients can never be substituted. Humans process natural materials for use in todayâ€™s ever-changing world and destroy their rawness and individuality. Human activities have an impact on nature, and as a result, the quality of the environment is deteriorating. Deterioration of nature is primarily caused by pollution of the air and water. The oxygen produced by a single fully-grown tree is enough to supply ten people, and the amount of oxygen released by a forest is unquestionably adequate for a metropolis or town. Nature is a healer, and it is the foundation for many industries. Nature, on the other hand, is both a giver and a taker, according to legends.</p>
